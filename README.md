# Rememberable Password Generator
This is a project similar to my [previous one](https://github.com/santitomatis/password-generator) (just a password generator) but this time I want the password that is created to be easier to remember, that's why this generator provides you a combination of nouns that you can remeber.

### Demo
When you run this script you are going to be asked wether you like to configure advanced stuff or just go by default

```
Welcome to The Rememberable Password Generator Project
Do you want to do some advanced configuration? Just type y/n (yes or no)
```

If you type n, a random password is going to be generated for you

```
Your password is:
archives sidewalk objective
Remember that this password is case-senstive (if you copy and paste it, you're going to have to remember if it was uppercase, capitalized, etc the next time you log in)
```

In the other hand if you type y, the amount of words it hasamong other details are going to be custom
